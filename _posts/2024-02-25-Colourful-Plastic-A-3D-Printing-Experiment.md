# Colourful Plastic - A 3D printing experiment



At my work, back in the Christmas, I 3D printed the logo of our product, Planwisely (a visualisation tool for transport planners made by the company I work at) and snuck them onto the Christmas trees in the lobby of the Brisbane and Melbourne offices. I hastily designed these decorations and were 3d printed with white and black filament.

Our product manager Steph mentioned that it would cool if we had an earrings version of them. While I was recovering from having my wisdom teeth removed, I had a go at making Planwisely earrings. I initially started on scaling down the model of the logo I made for the tree. I ordered an assorted selection of plastic filament. I experimented with my 3d printer's settings. I reduced the print speed, and applied ironing to the print to make sure the top surface would be smooth. I typically haven't used my printer for aesthetic purposes, I didn't have high expectation that this print would work out correctly. However, I was surprised the small, coloured pieces clicked in without adjusting the size of each piece. The base and black outline were printed as a single piece and the coloured pieces were printed separately and glued in. I bought the earring pins and hoops online and assembled the earrings.



 I was happy with how these earrings turned out and I put them on a textured carboard card to make them look like a finished product.
